# MyFace Social Network API

## My Task

In this assignment I built an API for a social nerwork web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. I used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the mongoose ODM.

Because this application wonâ€™t be deployed, I also created a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality.

## User Story

```md
